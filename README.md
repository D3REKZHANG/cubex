Demo appears laggy because it is a gif. 

<b>Node.js</b> backend can be found [here](https://github.com/D3REKZHANG/cubex-backend).

<h2> Implementation Details </h2>

Frontend is built with <b>React</b>.

I styled the webpage with <b>plain CSS</b> to learn the fundamentals before moving on to libraries like Styled Components or Material UI.

User data is stored on <b>MongoDB Atlas</b>. Don't worry, passwords are <b>hashed</b> before stored!
